# Kotlin-to-Swift porting plan

The desktop Kotlin app remains the behavioral reference. Work through these stages in order and verify each slice before expanding the next one. A Swift model alone does not imply that its provider, scanner, or screen is functional.

| Stage | Kotlin source | Native destination | Completion gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Shared market contract | `core/model`, scanner `ScanResult` | `MiMiTrends/Sources/Models` | Model fields and defaults are mapped; representative desktop fixtures round-trip; minute-bar and volume rules match | Complete |
| 2. First provider | `finnhub-ws/FinnhubWebSocketClient` | Native Finnhub WebSocket adapter and Keychain credential storage | Desktop test fixtures decode, failures are handled, and a foreground feed can fetch data | Implemented; live account test pending |
| 3. Scanner and storage | `app/shortmove`, `database` | Native scanner services and SQLite repositories | Deterministic signal fixtures agree with desktop; schema and migrations are tested; scans stop outside foreground | In progress: move and corridor detection, quote gate, storage, bounded bar snapshot import |
| 4. Product screens | `charts`, `app` | Adaptive SwiftUI Radar, charts, watchlists, broker import | Real signals are visible on iPhone and iPad; selected Mac workflows work inside App Sandbox | In progress: adaptive Radar dashboard, saved-bar chart, desktop bar import, local watchlist |
| 5. Distribution | Desktop data export and native app | Signed archives and App Store Connect metadata | Data rights, privacy, sandbox, device tests, archive validation, and review access are complete | Pending |

## Stage 1 mapping

- `VolumeStatus` keeps the desktop enum's raw names and aggregation rules. `MinuteBar.isValid` ports `isValidMinuteBar()` from `core/model/MinuteBarValidation.kt`.
- `ProviderInstrument` and `ProviderQuoteSnapshot` preserve provider identity, currency, numeric timestamps, and nullable quote fields. An adapter must supply `updatedAtMillis` explicitly; the desktop constructor's current-time default is not used in a persisted native model.
- `ScanResult` carries the current desktop fields and defaults. The executable-quote, recent-dynamics, entry-quality, analysis-time, and retention values are modeled but have no scanner implementation yet.
- Desktop `Double.NaN` sentinels for unavailable metrics become `nil` at the native adapter boundary. The desktop `entryQualityScore = -1` sentinel also becomes `nil`. This permits normal JSON encoding and prevents unavailable metrics from being mistaken for measured values.
- Tests use the values from the desktop `TestScanResult` helper and representative repository fixtures. They check model behavior and serialization; they are not evidence that a provider or scanner has been ported.

## Next step

Run the Finnhub feed on a device with a user-entered key, including connection failure, Stop, and background transitions. Verify the account's bid/ask endpoint access, data coverage, and display rights before distribution. Continue stage 3 with broker-data migration, then a licensed source for European quotes. The bounded desktop bar and watchlist snapshots are separate migration slices. Currency conversion for display needs its own explicit reference-rate label; execution-quality checks must not treat a daily reference rate as a live executable FX quote.

The local watchlist now ports the desktop `user_watchlist` symbol, insertion-time order, duplicate-ignore, and delete behavior into a separate native SQLite database. A read-only desktop exporter produces a bounded JSON snapshot of this table; the native importer validates all entries before merging them transactionally without replacing existing symbols. Selecting a row stops any active feed and fills Radar's symbol field. It does not port desktop instrument search, automatic multi-symbol scanning, or cross-device sync.

The Radar dashboard now follows the layout hierarchy in the desktop `Doc/LiveRadar.png` reference: recent detections, source status, and a selected-symbol chart. Its list loads bounded native signal history and uses event badges, signed movement windows, relative age, and a distinct rapid-crash row appearance; its source panel reports the actual Finnhub session. The chart uses up to 360 persisted OHLC minute bars for 1H, 3H, and 1D views, or the last 60 for Latest. It draws reported volume and EMA 9/21 from saved closes with the desktop smoothing rule. Missing minutes are never filled, and EMA lines break at gaps. It does not show disconnected desktop providers as active, synthesize alerts, or assert a live price when only saved history is available. On narrow layouts the panels stack vertically.

## Chart API decision

- Render native charts with [Swift Charts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/creating-a-chart-using-swift-charts). The first screen reads a bounded window from the native SQLite `minute_bars` table off the main actor, then displays completed close prices and bars with reported volume. It does not create candles from quotes or invent missing history.
- The Kotlin `ChartDataLoader` combines local history, provider minute tails, currency conversion, and broker trades. These remain separate native tasks. The Chart tab now shares the native candle, EMA, and reported-volume plot with Radar, with rolling 1H, 3H, and 1D ranges plus a bounded Latest view, a 360-bar cap, and no provider historical backfill. The desktop snapshot exporter copies at most 360 bars for one symbol; the native importer validates the format before committing them to native storage.
- [Finnhub's official client](https://github.com/Finnhub-Stock-API/finnhub-go) exposes a Stock Candles API that may be evaluated for an authenticated history adapter. Account entitlement, symbol coverage, retention, and display rights must be checked before enabling it. Do not carry over the desktop's undocumented Yahoo chart endpoint into the App Store build.

## Stage 2 mapping

- `FinnhubTradeDecoder` ports the desktop WebSocket client's `trade` envelope and `s`/`p`/`t`/`v` fields. The fixture is based on its Kotlin unit-test message and also covers multiple trades. Invalid records are skipped, while malformed or rejected messages produce a concise error.
- `FinnhubTradeStream` connects to the same `wss://ws.finnhub.io` endpoint, sends a text subscription, and closes its socket on cancellation. Radar's existing scene lifecycle stops the session outside the foreground. A run identifier rejects late callbacks from an older feed after a new one starts.
- `FinnhubCredentialStore` keeps the user-entered key in the device Keychain. The key is not bundled, placed in UserDefaults, logged, or copied from the desktop configuration.
- The Radar screen first displayed connection state and received trades for provider verification; stage 3 adds a rapid-rise diagnostic and bar persistence. Full product presentation remains later work.

## Stage 3 mapping

- `FinnhubMinuteAggregator` follows the desktop minute-boundary rule and publishes only a completed minute. The partial current minute is discarded when the feed stops.
- `MarketBarStore` writes completed bars to a native SQLite database in Application Support. Native migration 1 is transactional and append-only; the `minute_bars` columns and update-if-changed rule match the relevant desktop table. The store rejects invalid bars, uses WAL, and checks integrity on open. Desktop schema 21 is not opened or imported directly.
- `RapidRiseDetector` ports the close-confirmed rise threshold, freshness, reported-volume, gap, and turnover checks from `ShortMoveDetector`. `RapidCrashDetector` adds the rapid and accelerating-decline thresholds, preceding-low check, and the same activity gate. `SustainedMoveDetector` follows the desktop's longer-window price, reported turnover, minimum span, bar count, and gap rules. `TradableCorridorDetector` ports the two-hour, local-market-day range using the desktop's HF8 quantiles, edge touches, containment, drift, and remaining-room score. Detectors retain the desktop priority: crash, rise, sustained move, corridor. Full ranking behavior remains unported.
- `ShortMoveQuoteQuality` ports the desktop's 0.30% spread and 2% price-deviation gates. The pipeline applies it only to a matching quote observed within two minutes. `FinnhubBidAskClient` requests the separate US-stock last bid/ask endpoint with the user-entered key in an HTTP header; `FinnhubBidAskSampler` limits requests to one per minute and stops after an access denial. The live US-symbol feed now supplies these quotes to the gate when the account permits access. The trade WebSocket itself has no bid/ask fields. Currency conversion is still missing, so the deviation gate applies only when the market and quote currencies are both USD; the spread gate remains currency independent.
- The live feed writes a completed bar and evaluates at most three hours of recent bars off the main actor. The detector order matches the desktop app. A separate WAL-backed signal database in Application Support records each accepted `(symbol, source, event time)` once and supports bounded recent-history reads. The Radar screen still shows only the latest move; historical presentation is later product work.

## European quote and FX boundary

- The desktop Euronext adapter depends on a website-specific encrypted response. The Apple app will use a documented, licensed quote source instead of shipping that website parser. [Euronext Web Services](https://www.euronext.com/en/data/how-access-market-data/web-services) offers quotes through a JSON API; [Euronext's market-data policy](https://www.euronext.com/en/data/real-time-data/pricing-specs-agreements/market-data-pricing-policies) distinguishes internal use and redistribution. No European bid/ask adapter is active yet.
- The desktop app reads the daily [ECB EUR/USD reference rate](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html). The ECB says reference rates are for information and discourages transaction use. A future native conversion may use them for labelled approximate display values, while quote-quality comparisons must use matching currencies or a suitable live FX source.
